# DataProber

This is a builder which creates an ImageBuilder that lets you process probe
datasets. The implementation relies on a single off-screen canvas to generate the
resulting image of a image stack.

```js
var DataProberImageBuilder = require('tonic-image-builder/lib/builder/DataProber'),
    instance = new DataProberImageBuilder(qdm, lutManager);
```

## constructor(queryDataModel, lookupTableManager)

Create an instance of a DataProber using the associated
__queryDataModel__ that should be used to fetch the data and the associated set
of LookupTable managed by the __lookupTableManager__ instance.

Under the hood this will create an off-screen canvas for the image generation.
Then, depending if the method setPushMethodAsImage() has been called,
the 'image-ready' notification will not contain the same object.
By default we use the setPushMethodAsBuffer() configuration.

Below are the two event structures

```js
// setPushMethodAsBuffer()
var eventAsBuffer = {
    canvas: DOMElement,
    imageData: ImageDataFromCanvas,
    area: [0, 0, width, height],
    outputSize: [width, height],
    builder: this
};

// setPushMethodAsImage()
var eventAsImage = {
    url: 'data:image/png:ASDGFsdfgsdgf...'
    builder: this
};
```

## update()

Trigger the fetching of the data (composite.json + rgb.jpg).

## setPushMethodAsBuffer()

Change the method to share the image to the outside world.
After the method gets called, the notification event will look as follows:

```js
{
    canvas: DOMElement,
    imageData: ImageDataFromCanvas,
    area: [0, 0, width, height],
    outputSize: [width, height],
    builder: this
}
```

## setPushMethodAsImage()

Change the method to share the image to the outside world.
After the method gets called, the notification event will look as follows:

```js
{
    url: 'data:image/png:ASDGFsdfgsdgf...',
    builder: this
}
```

## setProbe(x, y, z)

Update the current probe location. [x,y,z] must be integers and be within the
extent of the dataset.

## getProbe() : [x, y, z]

Return the current probe location within the dataset.

## setField(fieldName)

Set which field should be rendered.

## getField() : fieldName

Return the name of the field that is currently used.

## getFields() : [ ... ]

Return the set of possible fields that can be set.

## getLookupTable() : LookupTable

Return the LookupTable associated to the current __field__.

## getLookupTableManager() : LookupTableManager

Return the LookupTableManager instance that was provided at the creation of
this instance.

## render()

Process the current set of loaded data and render it into the background canvas.
Once done, an event is triggered to let the application know that the image is
ready to be rendered/display somewhere.

Under the hood, one of the following methods [renderXY, renderZY, renderXZ] will be called.

## onImageReady(callback) : subscription

This allows the registration of a __callback(data, envelope)__ function when the
actual generated image is ready.

## TopicImageReady() : 'image-ready'

Return the topic used for the notification of the image.

## destroy()

Free the internal resources of the current instance.

## getRenderMethod()

Returns the current render method.

## getRenderMethods()

Returns the available render methods: `['XY', 'ZY', 'XZ']`.

## * renderXY()

Concrete render method that gets called by the generic __render()__ one.

## * renderZY()

Concrete render method that gets called by the generic __render()__ one.

## * renderXZ()

Concrete render method that gets called by the generic __render()__ one.

## * pushToFront(width, height)

Triggers a event notification that says the image is ready. This will call the proper
method to either send the ImageData or an ImageURL.

## * pushToFrontAsImage(width, height)

Called as __pushToFront__ when __setPushMethodAsImage()__ is used.

## * pushToFrontAsBuffer(width, height)

Called as __pushToFront__ when setPushMethodAsBuffer()__ is used.

## * applyLookupTable(width, height)

Internal method used to convert RGB encoded scalar values into the appropriate
color based on the current LookupTable setting.

## * getYOffset(slice) : Integer

Internal method used to return the offset index of the image that should be used
within the current image sprite.

## * getImage(slice, callback)

Internal method used to call the callback method on the image when that one is
ready.

## isCrossHairEnabled()

Returns true if the probe crosshair is visible.

## setCrossHairEnabled(useCrossHair)

Enables or disables the probe crosshair depending on the truthy value of useCrossHair.

## onImageReady(callback)

Calls _callback_ when the image is ready.

## onProbeLineReady(callback)

Calls _callback_ when the probe line is drawn.

## onProbeChange(callback)

Calls _callback_ when the probe coordinates change.

## onRenderMethodChange(callback)

Calls _callback_ when the render method changes.

## onCrosshairVisibilityChange(callback)

Calls _callback_ when the crosshair changes visibility.
